  <h1>Backtracking</h1>
</b>
 <!-- The developer and design by Varun jha -->

<body>
  <p>Backtracking is a form of recursion</p>
  <p>
    The usual scenario is that you are faced with a number of options, and you
    must choose one of these. After you make your <br />
    choice you will get a new set of options; just what set of options you get
    depends on what choice you made. This procedure is <br />
    repeated over and over until you reach a final state. If you made a good
    sequence of choices, your final state is a goal state; if <br />
    you didn't, it isn't. <br />
    <br />
    Conceptually, you start at the root of a tree; the tree probably has some
    good leaves and some bad leaves, though it may be that <br />
    the leaves are all good or all bad. You want to get to a good leaf. At
    each node, beginning with the root, you choose one of its <br />
    children to move to, and you keep this up until you get to a leaf. <br />
    <br />
    Suppose you get to a bad leaf. You can backtrack to continue the search
    for a good leaf by revoking your most recent choice, <br />
    and trying out the next option in that set of options. If you run out of
    options, revoke the choice that got you here, and try <br />
    another choice at that node. If you end up at the root with no options
    left, there are no good leaves to be found.
  </p>

  <p>This needs an example</p>
  <br />
  <img src="Image.jpg" alt="Image backtracking" />
  <br />
  <br />
  <ol type="1">
    <li>Starting at Root, your options are A and B. You choose A.</li>
    <br />
    <li>At A, your options are C and D. You choose C.</li>
    <br />
    <li>C is bad. Go back to A.</li>
    <br />
    <li>At A, you have already tried C, and it failed. Try D.</li>
    <br />
    <li>D is bad. Go back to A.</li>
    <br />
    <li>At A, you have no options left to try. Go back to Root.</li>
    <br />
    <li>At Root, you have already tried A. Try B.</li>
    <br />
    <li>At B, your options are E and F. Try E.</li>
    <br />
    <li>E is good. Congratulations!</li>
    <br />
  </ol>
  
  <p>
    In this example we drew a picture of a tree. The tree is an abstract model
    of the possible sequences of choices we could <br />
    make. There is also a data structure called a tree, but usually we don't
    have a data structure to tell us what choices <br />
    we have. (If we do have an actual tree data structure, backtracking on it
    is called depth-first tree searching.)
  </p>

  <h3>The backtracking algorithm.</h3>
  <pre>
  boolean solve(Node n) <br>
  { if n is a leaf node { <br>
     if the leaf is a goal node,return true <br>
      else return false <br>
     } else { <br>
       for each child c of n { <br>
         if solve(c) succeeds, return true <br>
       } <br>
        return false <br>
      } <br>
   }
</pre>
  <p>
    Notice that the algorithm is expressed as a boolean function. This is
    essential to understanding the algorithm. If <br />
    solve(n) is true, that means node n is part of a solution--that is, node n
    is one of the nodes on a path from the root to <br />
    some goal node. We say that n is solvable. If solve(n) is false, then
    there is no path that includes n to any goal node.
  </p>
  <br />
  <b>How does this work?</b>
  <ul type="disc">
    <li>If any child of n is solvable, then n is solvable.</li>
    <li>If no child of n is solvable, then n is not solvable.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    Hence, to decide whether any non-leaf node n is solvable (part of a path
    to a goal node), all you have to do is test whether any <br />
    child of n is solvable. This is done recursively, on each child of n. In
    the above code, this is done by the lines
  </p>
  <pre>
      for each child c of n { <br>
         if solve(c) succeeds, return true
      } 
      return false
    </pre>
  <p>
    Eventually the recursion will "bottom" out at a leaf node. If the leaf
    node is a goal node, it is solvable; if the leaf node is not a goal <br />
    node, it is not solvable. This is our base case. In the above code, this
    is done by the lines
  </p>
  <pre>
      if n is a leaf node <br>
       { if the leaf is a goal node, return true <br>
        else return false 
      }
    </pre>
  <p>
    The backtracking algorithm is simple but important. You should understand
    it thoroughly. Another way of stating it is as follows:
  </p>
  <br />
  <ul type="disc">
    <h3>
      <strong>
        <li>To search a tree:</li>
      </strong>
    </h3>
  </ul>
  <ol type="1">
    <li>
      If the tree consists of a single leaf, test whether it is a goal node.
    </li>
    <li>
      Otherwise, search the subtrees until you find one containing a goal
      node, or until you have <br />
      searched them all unsuccessfully.
    </li>
  </ol>
  <br />
  <h3>
    <b>
      <p>Non-recursive backtracking, using a stack</p>
    </b>
  </h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    Backtracking is a rather typical recursive algorithm, and any recursive
    algorithm can be rewritten as a stack algorithm. In fact,<br />
    that is how your recursive algorithms are translated into machine or
    assembly language.
  </p>
  <pre>
       boolean solve(Node n) { <br>
          put node n on the stack; <br>
           while the stack is not empty { <br>
            if the node at the top of the stack is a leaf { <br>
              if it is a goal node, return true <br>
               else pop it off the stack <br>
              } <br>
               else { <br>
                if the node at the top of the stack has untried children <br>
                  push the next untried child onto the stack <br>
                else pop the node off the stack <br>
                
                } 
                return false 
              }
      </pre>
  <p>
    Starting from the root, the only nodes that can be pushed onto the stack
    are the children of the node currently on the top of the <br />
    stack, and these are only pushed on one child at a time; hence, the nodes
    on the stack at all times describe a valid path in the <br />
    tree. Nodes are removed from the stack only when it is known that they
    have no goal nodes among their descendents. Therefore, <br />
    if the root node gets removed (making the stack empty), there must have
    been no goal nodes at all, and no solution to the <br />
    problem. <br />
    <br />
    When the stack algorithm terminates successfully, the nodes on the stack
    form (in reverse order) a path from the root to a goal <br />
    node. <br />
    <br />
    Similarly, when the recursive algorithm finds a goal node, the path
    information is embodied (in reverse order) in the sequence of <br />
    recursive calls. Thus as the recursion unwinds, the path can be recovered
    one node at a time, by (for instance) printing the node <br />
    at the current level, or storing it in an array. <br />
    <br />
    Here is the recursive backtracking algorithm, modified slightly to print
    (in reverse order) the nodes along the successful path:
  </p>
  <br />
  <pre>
      boolean solve(Node n) { <br>
         if n is a leaf node { <br>
          if the leaf is a goal node { <br>
             print n <br>
             return true <br>
           } <br>
              else return false <br>
         } else { <br>
           for each child c of n { <br>
             if solve(c) succeeds { <br>
                print n <br>
                return true <br>
               } <br>
              } return false <br>
            } 
          }
    </pre>
  <b>
    <h3>Keeping backtracking simple</h3>
  </b>
  All of these versions of the backtracking algorithm are pretty simple,
    but when applied to a real problem, they can get pretty <br />
    cluttered up with details. Even determining whether the node is a leaf can
    be complex: <br />
    <br />
    for example, if the path represents a series of moves in a chess endgame
    problem, the leaves are the checkmate and stalemate <br />
    solutions <br />
    <br />
    To keep the program clean, therefore, tests like this should be buried in
    methods. In a chess game, for example, you could test <br />
    whether a node is a leaf by writing a <b> gameOver method </b>(or you could
    even call it <b> isLeaf).</b> This method would encapsulate all the <br />
    ugly details of figuring out whether any possible moves remain. <br />
    <br />
    Notice that the backtracking altorithms require us to keep track, for each
    node on the current path, which of its children have <br />
    been tried already (so we don't have to try them again). In the above code
    we made this look simple, by just saying
    <b>
      for each child <br />
      c of n.</b>
    In reality, it may be difficult to figure out what the possible children
    are, and there may be no obvious way to step through <br />
    them. In chess, for example, a node can represent one arrangement of pieces
    on a chessboard, and each child of that node can <br />
    represent the arrangement after some piece has made a legal move. How do you
    find these children, and how do you keep track <br />
    of which ones you've already examined? <br />
    <br />
    The most straightforward way to keep track of which children of the node
    have been tried is as follows: Upon initial entry to the <br />
    node (that is, when you first get there from above), make a list of all its
    children. As you try each child, take it off the list. When <br />
    the list is empty, there are no remaining untried children, and you can
    return "failure." This is a simple approach, but it may require <br />
    quite a lot of additional work. <br />
    <br />
    There is an easier way to keep track of which children have been tried, if
    you can define an ordering on the children. If there is an <br />
    ordering, and you know which child you just tried, you can determine which
    child to try next. <br />
    <br />
    For example, you might be able to number the
    <b> children 1 through n,</b> and try them in numerical order. Then, if you
    have just tried <br />
    <b> child k,</b> you know that you have already tried children 1 through
    <b> k-1,</b> and you have not yet tried children <b> k+1</b> through
    <b> n.</b> Or, if you <br />
    are trying to color a map with just four colors, you can always try
    <b> red first, then yellow, then green, then blue.</b> If child yellow
    fails, <br />
    you know to try child green next. If you are searching a maze, you can try
    choices in the order left, straight, right
    <b>(or perhaps <br />
      north, east, south, west).</b>
    <br />
    <br />
    It isn't always easy to find a simple way to order the children of a node.
    <b> In the chess game example,</b> you might number your <br />
    pieces (or perhaps the squares of the board) and try them in numerical
    order; but in addition each piece may also have several <br />
    moves, and these must also be ordered. <br />
    <br />
    <br />
    <h3>Example: Tree Search</h3>
    <p>
      For starters, let's do the simplest possible example of backtracking,
      which is searching an actual tree. We will also use the <br />
      simplest kind of tree, a binary tree. <br />
      <br />
      A binary tree is a data structure composed of nodes. One node is
      designated as the root node. Each node can reference (point <br />
      to) zero, one, or two other nodes, which are called its children. The
      children are referred to as the left child and/or the right child. <br />
      All nodes are reachable (by one or more steps) from the root node, and
      there are no cycles. For our purposes, although this is not <br />
      part of the definition of a binary tree, we will say that a node might or
      might not be a goal node, and will contain its name. The <br />
      first example in this paper (which we repeat here) shows a binary tree.
      <br />
      <br />
      Here's a definition of the BinaryTree class:
    </p>
    <pre>
        public class BinaryTree { <br>
           BinaryTree leftChild = null;<br>
           BinaryTree rightChild = null; <br>
           boolean isGoalNode = false; <br>
           String name; <br>
              <br>
        BinaryTree(String name, BinaryTree left, BinaryTree right, boolean isGoalNode) { <br>
            this.name = name; <br>
            leftChild = left; <br>
            rightChild = right; <br>
            this.isGoalNode = isGoalNode; <br>
          }
      }
       </pre>
    <br />
    <p>
      Next we will create a TreeSearch class, and in it we will define a method
      makeTree() which constructs the above binary tree.
    </p>
    <pre>
      <br>
  static BinaryTree makeTree() { <br>
     BinaryTree root, a, b, c, d, e, f; <br>
      c = new BinaryTree("C", null, null, false); <br>
      d = new BinaryTree("D", null, null, false); <br>
      e = new BinaryTree("E", null, null, true); <br>
      f = new BinaryTree("F", null, null, false); <br>
      a = new BinaryTree("A", c, d, false); <br>
      b = new BinaryTree("B", e, f, false); <br>
      root = new BinaryTree("Root", a, b, false); <br>
      return root; <br>
    }
</pre>
    <p>Here's a main program to create a binary tree and try to solve it:</p>
    <br />
    <pre>
  public static void main(String args[]) { <br>
     BinaryTree tree = makeTree(); <br>
      System.out.println(solvable(tree)); <br>
    }
</pre>
    <p>
      And finally, here's the recursive backtracking routine to "solve" the
      binary tree by finding a goal node.
    </p>
    <br />
    <pre>
  static boolean solvable(BinaryTree node) { <br>
  /* 1 */ if (node == null) return false; <br>
  /* 2 */ if (node.isGoalNode) return true; <br>
  /* 3 */ if (solvable(node.leftChild)) return true; <br>
  /* 4 */ if (solvable(node.rightChild)) return true; <br>
  /* 5 */ return false; <br>
  }
</pre>
    <p>Here's what the numbered lines are doing:</p>
    <ol type="1">
      <li>
        If we are given a null node, it's not solvable. This statement is so
        that we can call this method with the children of a node, without <br />
        first checking whether those children actually exist.
      </li>
      <li>
        If the node we are given is a goal node, return success.If the node we
        are given is a goal node, return success.
      </li>
      <li>
        See if the left child of node is solvable, and if so, conclude that node
        is solvable. We will only get to this line if node is non-null <br />
        and is not a goal node, says to
      </li>
      <li>Do the same thing for the right child.</li>
      <li>
        Since neither child of node is solvable, node itself is not solvable.
      </li>
    </ol>
    <br />
    <p>
      This program runs correctly and produces the unenlightening result true.
    </p>
    <p>
      Each time we ask for another node, we have to check if it is null. In the
      above we put that check as the first thing in solvable. <br />
      An alternative would be to check first whether each child exists, and
      recur only if they do. Here's that alternative version:
    </p>
    <br />
    <pre>
        static boolean solvable(BinaryTree node) { <br>
           if (node.isGoalNode) return true; <br>
           if (node.leftChild != null && solvable(node.leftChild)) return true; <br>
           if (node.rightChild != null && solvable(node.rightChild)) return true; <br>
           return false; <br>
         }
        </pre>
    <p>I think the first version is simpler, but the second version is slightly more efficient.</p>
    <hr>
    <h3>What are the children?</h3>
    <p> One of the things that simplifies the above binary tree search is that, at each choice point, you can ignore all
      the previous <br> choices. Previous choices don't give you any information about what you should do next; as far
      as you know, both the left and the <br> right child are possible solutions. In many problems, however, you may be
      able to eliminate children immediately, without <br> recursion. <br>
      <br>
      Consider, for example, the problem of four-coloring a map. It is a theorem of mathematics that any map on a plane,
      no matter <br> how convoluted the countries are, can be colored with at most four colors, so that no two countries
      that share a border are the <br> same color. <br>
      <br>
      To color a map, you choose a color for the first country, then a color for the second country, and so on, until
      all countries are <br>
      colored. <br>
      <br>
      There are two ways to do this:
      <br>
    <ul>
      <li>Method 1. Try each of the four possible colors, and recur. When you run out of countries, check whether you
        are at a goal node.</li>
      <li>Method 2. Try only those colors that have not already been used for an adjacent country, and recur. If and
        when you run out of <br> countries, you have successfully colored the map.</li>
    </ul>
    </p>
    <p>Let's apply each of these two methods to the problem of coloring a checkerboard. This should be easily solvable;
      after all, a <br> checkerboard only needs two colors.</p>
    <br>
    <p> <b> boolean mapIsOK()</b> <br>
      Used by method 1 to check (at a leaf node) whether the entire map is colored correctly. <br>
      <br>
      <b> boolean okToColor(int row, int column, int color)</b> <br>
      Used by method 2 to check, at every node, whether there is an adjacent node already colored with the given color.
      <br>
      <br>
      <strong> int[] nextRowAndColumn(int row, int column) </strong> <br>
      Used by both methods to find the next "country" (actually, the row and column of the next square on the
      checkerboard).
    </p>
    <br>
    <p>Here's the code for method 1:</p>
    <pre>
      boolean explore1(int row, int column, int color) { <br> 
        if (row >= NUM_ROWS)return mapIsOK(); <br>
        map[row][column] = color; <br>
        for (int nextColor = RED; nextColor <= BLUE; nextColor++) { <br>
          int[] next = nextRowAndColumn(row, column); <br>
          if (explore1(next[0], next[1], nextColor)) return true; <br>
         } <br>
          return false; <br>
       }
    </pre>
    <br>
    <p>And here's the code for method 2:</p>
    <pre>
      boolean explore2(int row, int column, int color) { <br>
      if (row >= NUM_ROWS)return true; <br>
      if (okToColor(row, column, color)) { <br>
         map[row][column] = color; <br>
         for (int nextColor = RED; nextColor <= BLUE; nextColor++) { <br>
         int[] next = nextRowAndColumn(row, column); <br>
         if (explore2(next[0], next[1], nextColor)) return true; <br>
       } <br>
     } <br>
     return false; <br>
   }
    </pre>
    <br>
    <p>Those appear pretty similar, and you might think they are equally good. However, the timing information suggests
      otherwise:</p>
    <table border="2" height="10%" width="50%" align="center">
      <tr>
        <td> </td>
        <td bgcolor="#D8D8D8">2 by 3 map</td>
        <td bgcolor="#D8D8D8">3 by 3 map</td>
        <td bgcolor="#D8D8D8">3 by 4 map</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td bgcolor="#D8D8D8">Method 1</td>
        <td>60 ms</td>
        <td>940 ms</td>
        <td>60530 ms (1 minute)</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td bgcolor="#D8D8D8">Method 2</td>
        <td>0 ms</td>
        <td>0 ms</td>
        <td>0 ms</td>
      </tr>
    </table>
    <br>
    <p>The zeros in the above table indicate times too short to measure (less than 1 millisecond). Why this huge
      difference? Either <br> of these methods could have exponential growth. Eliminating a node automatically
      eliminates all
      of its descendents, and this will <br> often prevent exponential growth. Conversely, by waiting to check until a
      leaf
      node is reached, exponential growth is practically <br> guaranteed. If there is any way to eliminate children
      (reduce
      the set of choices), do so!</p> <br>
    <h3>Debugging techniques</h3>
    <br>
    <p>Often our first try at a program doesn't work, and we need to debug it. Debuggers are helpful, but sometimes we
      need to fall <br> back on inserting print statements. There are some simple tricks to making effective use of
      print
      statements. These tricks can be <br> applied to any program, but are especially useful when you are trying to
      debug
      recursive routines.</p> <br>

    <p> <b>Trick #1: Indent when you print method entries and exits.</b> <br>
      <br>
      Often, the best debugging technique is to print every
      method call and return (or at least the most important ones). You probably <br> want to print, for each method,
      what
      parameters it came in with, and what value it leaves with. However, if you just print a long <br> list of these,
      it's
      hard to match up method exits with their corresponding entries. Indenting to show the level of nesting can help.
    </p>
    <br>
    <p> <b> Trick #2: Use specialized print methods for debugging.</b> <br>
      <br>
      Don't clutter up your actual code more than you must.
      Also, remember that code inserted for debugging purposes can itself <br> contain bugs, or (in the worst case) can
      affect the results, so be very careful with it.
    </p>
    <br>
    <p>Here's our debugging code. For this trivial program, <br> there's almost more debugging code than actual code,
      but in
      larger programs the proportions will be better.</p>
    <br>
    <pre>
        static String indent = ""; <br>
        static String name(BinaryTree node) { <br>
           if (node == null) return null; <br>
            else return node.name; <br>
          } <br>
           <br>
        static void enter(BinaryTree node) { <br>
            System.out.println(indent + "Entering solvable(" + name(node) + ")"); <br>
            indent = indent + "| "; <br>
          } <br>
         <br>
        static boolean yes(BinaryTree node) { <br>
           indent = indent.substring(3); <br>
           System.out.println(indent + "solvable(" + name(node) + ") returns true"); <br>
           return true; <br>
         } 
         <br>
         static boolean no(BinaryTree node) { <br>
           indent = indent.substring(3); <br>
           System.out.println(indent + "solvable(" + name(node) + ") returns false"); <br>
           return false; <br>
         } <br>
      </pre>
    <p>To use this code, we modify solvable as follows:</p>
    <br>
    <pre>
        static boolean solvable(BinaryTree node) { <br>
          enter(node); <br>
          if (node == null) return no(node); <br>
          if (node.isGoalNode) return yes(node); <br>
          if (solvable(node.leftChild)) return yes(node); <br>
          if (solvable(node.rightChild)) return yes(node); <br>
          return no(node); <br>
       }
      </pre>

    <p>And we get these results:</p>
    <pre>Entering solvable(Root) <br>
      | Entering solvable(A) <br>
      | | Entering solvable(C) <br>
      | | | Entering solvable(null) <br>
      | | | solvable(null) returns false <br>
      | | | Entering solvable(null) <br>
      | | | solvable(null) returns false <br>
      | | solvable(C) returns false <br>
      | | Entering solvable(D) <br>
      | | | Entering solvable(null) <br>
      | | | solvable(null) returns false <br>
      | | | Entering solvable(null)
      | | | solvable(null) returns false <br>
      | | solvable(D) returns false <br>
      | solvable(A) returns false <br>
      | Entering solvable(B) <br>
      | | Entering solvable(E) <br>
      | | solvable(E) returns true <br>
      | solvable(B) returns true <br>
      solvable(Root) returns true <br>
      true <br>
    </pre>
    <br>
    <strong>
      <p> Trick #3: Never discard your debugging statements.</p>
    </strong>
    <br>
    <p>Writing debugging statements is programming, too. Often it's as much work to debug the debugging statements as it
      is to debug <br> the actual program. Once your program is working, why throw this code away? <br>
      <br>
      Obviously, you don't want
      to print out all this debugging information from a program you are ready to submit (or to turn over to <br> your
      manager). You could comment out your debugging calls, but that can be a lot of work. What's more, in the above
      example, <br> you would have to replace every return(yes(node)) with return(true), and every return(no(node)) with
      return false. With all these <br> changes, you might introduce new bugs into your program. <br>
      <br>
      The simple solution is to
      make your debugging statements conditional. For example,
    </p>
    <br>
    <pre>
        static final boolean debugging = false; <br>
        <br>
        static void enter(BinaryTree node) { <br>
           if (debugging) { <br>
           System.out.println(indent + "Entering solvable(" + name(node) + ")"); <br>
           indent = indent + "| "; <br>
         } <br>
       } <br>
       <br>
        static boolean yes(BinaryTree node) { <br>
           if (debugging) { <br>
           indent = indent.substring(3); <br>
           System.out.println(indent + "solvable(" + name(node) + ") returns true"); <br>
         } <br>
          return true; <br>
       } <br>
       <br>
        static boolean no(BinaryTree node) { <br>
           if (debugging) { indent = indent.substring(3); <br>
           System.out.println(indent + "solvable(" + name(node) + ") returns false"); <br>
           } <br>
            return false; <br>
        } <br>
        </pre>
    <p>
      In industry, actual programs often have multiple flags to control different aspects of debugging. Don't worry too
      much about <br> making your code larger; modern compilers will notice that since the variable debugging is final,
      it can never be true, and the <br> controlled code will be discarded. <br>
    </p>
    <br>
    <h3>Trick #4: Create an Exception.</h3>
    <p>
      If an Exception is thrown, you can get information about just where it happened by sending it the message <br>
      printStackTrace(PrintStream). Since an Exception is an object like any other, you can create and throw your own
      Exceptions. <br> However, Java programmers don't always realize that you can create an Exception without throwing
      it.
      For example, the following <br> code
    </p>
    <br>
    <pre>         new Exception("Checkpoint Charlie").printStackTrace(System.out);</pre>
    <br>
    <p>will print out a message something like this, and the program will then continue normally. That is, the above
      code just acts like a <br> print statement.</p>
    <br>
    <pre>java.lang.Exception: Checkpoint Charlie <br>
           at TreeSearch.solvable(TreeSearch.java:53) <br>
           at TreeSearch.solvable(TreeSearch.java:57) <br>
           at TreeSearch.main(TreeSearch.java:72) <br>

    <br>
    <h3>Example: Cindy's Puzzle</h3>
    <p>
      I call the following puzzle "Cindy's puzzle" for historical reasons. You have some number n of black marbles and
      the same number <br> of white marbles, and you have a playing board which consists simply of a line of 2n+1 spaces
      to
      put the marbles in. Start with <br> the black marbles all at one end (say, the left), the white marbles all at the
      other end, and a free space in between.
    </p>
    <table border="1" cellpadding="10" align="center">
      <td bgcolor="#D8D8D8"><img src="blackball.png" alt="Black ball"></td>
      <td bgcolor="#D8D8D8"><img src="blackball.png" alt="Black ball"></td>
      <td bgcolor="#D8D8D8"><img src="">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</td>
      <td bgcolor="#D8D8D8"><img src="whiteball.png" alt="White ball"></td>
      <td bgcolor="#D8D8D8"><img src="whiteball.png" alt="White ball"></td>
    </table>
    <p>The goal is to reverse the positions of the marbles:</p>
    <table border="1" cellpadding="10" align="center">
      <td bgcolor="#D8D8D8"><img src="whiteball.png" alt="Black ball"></td>
      <td bgcolor="#D8D8D8"><img src="whiteball.png" alt="Black ball"></td>
      <td bgcolor="#D8D8D8"><img src="">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</td>
      <td bgcolor="#D8D8D8"><img src="blackball.png" alt="White ball"></td>
      <td bgcolor="#D8D8D8"><img src="blackball.png" alt="White ball"></td>
    </table>
    <br>
    <strong>
      <p>The black marbles can only move to the right, and the white marbles can only move to the left (no backing up).
        At
        each move, a marble can either:</p>
    </strong>
    <br>
    <ul>
      <li>Move one space ahead, if that space is clear, or</li>
      <li>ump ahead over exactly one marble of the opposite color, if the space just beyond that marble is clear.</li>
    </ul>
    <br>

    <p>For example, you could make the following sequence of moves:</p>

      The backtracking method is named solvable and returns a boolean. In solvable we shall need to check
      whether we are at a leaf, <br> which in this case means a position from which no further moves are possible.
      This isn't so easy. <br>
      <br>
      Now to the program. The main program will initialize the board, and call a recursive
      backtracking routine to attempt to solve the <br> puzzle. The backtracking routine will either succeed and
      print out a winning path, or it will fail, and the main program will have to <br> print out the bad news. <br>
      <br>
      The
      backtracking method is named solvable and returns a boolean. In solvable we shall need to check whether we
      are at a leaf, <br> which in this case means a position from which no further moves are possible. This isn't so
      easy. <br>
      <br>
      Each possible move will result in a new board position, and these new board positions are the
      children of the current board <br> position. Hence to find the children of a node (that is, of a board
      position), we need only find the possible moves from that node. <br> Remember that it is also highly desirable
      to find an ordering on these possible moves. <br>
      <br>
      Here it is time to stop and take thought. To make progress,
      we must analyze the game to some extent. Probably a number of <br> approaches would work, and what follows is
      based on the way I worked it out. If you were to program this puzzle, you might find <br> a different but
      equally valid approach. <br>
      <br>
      First, notice that if a marble has a move, that move is unique: if it can move
      ahead one square, then it cannot jump. <br> If it can jump, it cannot move ahead one square. This suggests
      that, to find the possible moves, we might assign numbers to the marbles, and <br> check each marble in turn.
      When we have looked at all the marbles, we have looked at all the possible moves. This would require <br>
      having a table to keep track of where each marble is, or else somehow "marking" each marble with its
      number and searching the <br> board each time to find the marble we want. Neither alternative is very
      attractive. <br>
      <br>
      Next, notice that for a given board position, each marble occupies a unique space. Hence,
      instead of talking about moving a <br> particular marble, we can talk about moving the marble in a particular
      space. If a move is possible from a given space, then that <br> must be the only move possible from that space,
      because if the marble in that space has a move, it is unique. There is a slight <br> complication because not
      every space contains a marble, but at least the spaces (unlike the marbles) stay in one place.
    </p>
    <br>
    <strong>
      <p>Now we have a simpler ordering of moves to use in our program. Just check, in order, the 2n+1 spaces of the
        board. For each <br> space, either zero or one moves is possible. With this understanding, we can write a
        boolean
        method canMove(int[] board, int <br> position) which determines whether a move is possible from the given
        position:
      </p>
    </strong>
    <ul>
      <li>If the position is empty, no move is possible;</li>
      <li>If the position contains a black marble, the method checks for a move or jump to the right;</li>
      <li>If the position contains a white marble, the method checks for a move or jump to the left.</li>
    </ul>
    <br>
    <p>We write another method <b>int[] makeMove(int[] oldBoard, int position) </b> that will take a board and a
      position, make
      a move from <br> that position, and return as its value a new board. (We could write this somewhat more
      efficiently by
      changing the old board, <br> rather than creating a new one, but here we are more concerned with simplicity.) In
      technical jargon, makeMove is "applicative" <br> rather than "mutative." <br>
      <br>
      Along with <b>canMove and makeMove,</b> we are using
      methods <b> puzzleSolved and printBoard </b> with meanings that <br> should be obvious.
    </p>
    <br>

        boolean solvable(int[] board) { <br>
         if (puzzleSolved(board)) { <br>
           return true; <br>
         } <br>
         for (int position = 0; position < BOARD_SIZE; position++) { <br>
           if (canMove(board, position)) { <br>
             int[] newBoard = makeMove(board, position); <br>

    <p>Along with canMove and makeMove, we are using methods puzzleSolved and printBoard with meanings that should be
      obvious. <br>
      <br>
      Here is some output from the program:
    </p>
    <i>
      <ol type="1" reversed>
    </I>
    <b>
      <li> &nbsp; WHITE WHITE WHITE <ins>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</ins> BLACK BLACK BLACK</li>
    </b>
    <b>
      <li> &nbsp; WHITE WHITE WHITE BLACK <ins>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</ins> BLACK BLACK</li>
    </b>
    <b>
      <li> &nbsp; WHITE WHITE <ins>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</ins> BLACK WHITE BLACK BLACK</li>
    </b>
    <b>
      <li> &nbsp; WHITE <ins>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</ins> WHITE BLACK WHITE BLACK BLACK</li>
    </b>
    <b>
      <li> &nbsp; WHITE BLACK WHITE <ins>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</ins> WHITE BLACK BLACK</li>
    </b>
    <b>
      <li> &nbsp; WHITE BLACK WHITE BLACK WHITE <ins>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</ins> BLACK</li>
    </b>
    <b>
      <li> &nbsp; WHITE BLACK WHITE BLACK WHITE BLACK <ins>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</ins></li>
    </b>
    <b>
      <li> &nbsp; WHITE BLACK WHITE BLACK <ins>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</ins> BLACK WHITE</li>
    </b>
    <b>
      <li> &nbsp; WHITE BLACK <ins>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</ins> BLACK WHITE BLACK WHITE</li>
    </b>
    <b>
      <li> &nbsp; <ins>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</ins> BLACK WHITE BLACK WHITE BLACK WHITE</li>
    </b>
    <b>
      <li> &nbsp; BLACK <ins>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</ins> WHITE BLACK WHITE BLACK WHITE</li>
    </b>
    <b>
      <li> &nbsp; BLACK BLACK WHITE <ins>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</ins> WHITE BLACK BLACK</li>
    </b>
    <b>
      <li> &nbsp; BLACK BLACK WHITE BLACK WHITE <ins>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</ins> WHITE</li>
    </b>
    <b>
      <li> &nbsp; BLACK BLACK WHITE BLACK <ins>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</ins> WHITE WHITE</li>
    </b>
    <b>
      <li> &nbsp; BLACK BLACK <ins>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</ins> BLACK WHITE WHITE WHITE</li>
    </b>
    <b>
      <li> &nbsp; BLACK BLACK BLACK <ins>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</ins> WHITE WHITE WHITE</li>
    </b>

    </ol>
    <p>Notice that the solution is given in reverse order: BLACK starts out on the left and WHITE on the right, as in
      the last <br> line. I've added line numbers to the actual output in order to emphasize this point. Backtracking
      always
      produces its <br> results (sequence of choices) in reverse order; it is up to you, the programmer, to reverse the
      results again to get <br> them in the correct order.</p>
